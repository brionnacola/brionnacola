# Brionna Cola - Computer Programming and Analysis Major

## About Me 
Hello, I am Brionna! _Pronouns: she/her/hers_. I attend Valencia College in Orlando, Florida. I was born in Providence, Rhode Island and raised in the Central Florida area. I currently work for a major technology company. During the 15 years of working at the company, I have grown so much and have been given such amazing opportunities. I could not have asked for a better place to grow and develop over the years. You can learn more about my journey into tech [here](https://www.brionnacola.com/)!

The first computer I have personally owned (that wasn't a family computer) was a 2009 MacBook. I was in graphic design classes in high school and begged my parents for a MacBook since it is what we used in class, and they surprised me with it for graduation. I actually still have the computer as a collectible and to see how far MacBooks have come is quite surreal. My original machine had an optical drive in it! I can't even imagine owning a CD or any type of disk now.



## Fun Facts
My favorite class so far in my degree is Intorduction to Programming where we are learning about Python. The professor is really great! I have previous experience with the programming language but it is always nice to get a refresher. I am not that far into the degree so I am still going through classes so this will definitely change!

My favorite programming language so far has to be Python. My passion is to go into AI, as well as machine learning, and this is the best language for it. I also have experience with HTML, CSS, learning JavaScript now, and I have dabbled in C.

I'm looking to collaborate on an open source project that I can put on my resume as a project I have worked on. I am newer to using GitHub and I am getting used to the platform but I hope in the next coming months to add more to my portfolio.

I'm looking for help in growing my skills further and getting a mentor in the industry so if you are interested, please feel free to reach out!
